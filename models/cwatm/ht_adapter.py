"""HydroTuring adapter for CWatM 1.11, the Community Water Model (IIASA).

CWatM is a grid model driven by one settings file and netCDF maps. This
adapter builds the smallest domain CWatM accepts for a lumped catchment, one
active grid cell whose area is the catchment's, writes the forcing and every
parameter map that cell needs into a scratch directory, and runs the model
through its own entry points (parse_configuration, checkifDate, CWATModel,
ModelFrame), stepping the frame one row at a time so the stores can be read
after every step. Nothing in the model's code is patched.

What is reported
----------------
Fluxes as rates in mm per day, states as absolute storages in mm, all taken
from CWatM's own variables after each step (CWatM works in metres of water
over the cell; land-cover variables are its own fraction-weighted sums):

* `pr`       the forcing, echoed
* `evspsbl`  totalET: transpiration, bare-soil evaporation, open-water
             evaporation, interception evaporation and snow evaporation
* `sbl`      snowEvap, the snow evaporation counted once inside totalET. It
             is taken out of the snow cover, and the degree-day pack holds
             no liquid water, so what leaves it leaves the solid store; never
             above evspsbl and never negative. CWatM takes it at any
             temperature (snow_frost.py:788 has no temperature condition),
             about two thirds of it on days above 0 degC on the gate runs, so
             it is evaporation drawn from the solid snow store rather than
             resolved sublimation
* `snm`      Rain + SnowMelt + IceMelt: rain passing through the snow module
             plus both melt terms removed from SnowCover. CWatM's canopy
             interception is downstream of this snow-module boundary.
* `mrro`     runoff: surface runoff, interflow and baseflow after CWatM's
             runoff-concentration lag, i.e. what leaves the cell
* `dis`      the same over the catchment area, m3/s
* `gwex`     minus nonFossilGroundwaterAbs: the water CWatM's own
             water-demand module pumped out of storGroundwater to meet a
             prescribed withdrawal (`abstr`), zero without one
* `mrso`     sum_soil = sum_w1 + sum_w2 + sum_w3 (+ sum_topwater, zero
             without paddy fields)
* `snw`      SnowCover (the degree-day snow store; it holds no liquid water)
* `canopy`   sum_interceptStor
* `gw`       storGroundwater, the linear groundwater reservoir
* `channel`  gridcell_storage, runoff generated but still inside the
             runoff-concentration lag

Without a prescribed withdrawal CWatM has no exchange with the outside in
this configuration (no MODFLOW, no abstraction, no inflow) and `gwex` is
zero. With one, the water-demand module removes it (below) and `gwex` is
what it removed. The budget P - ET - Q + gwex = d(stores) is checked every
step against the reported stores, and against CWatM's own total water
storage tws = storGroundwater + totalSto + gridcell_storage; the largest
residuals are recorded in run.json.

Prescribed withdrawal
---------------------
A forcing with an `abstr` column (mm/day, net of return flow) switches on
CWatM's water-demand module (includeWaterDemand) and nothing else changes:
a forcing without the column writes the same settings, byte for byte, as
before, so no other probe can be touched. The withdrawal is given to CWatM
as an industrial demand map whose withdrawal and consumption are both
`abstr`, so it is fully consumptive and returns nothing; the domestic map is
zero and livestock is off. CWatM 1.11's demand readers are monthly only: they re-read on newStart
or a new month (industry.py:112-147), and water_demand.py:1267-1278 derives
nonIrrDemand, pot_nonIrrConsumption and nonIrrReturnFlowFraction only then.
The demand file therefore holds one record per month, the depth of the
month's first row stamped on that row's date, which CWatM's own read returns
on that day. Before every other step the adapter writes that row's depth
into industryDemand, pot_industryConsumption, nonIrrDemand and
pot_nonIrrConsumption (zero at or below CWatM's InvCellArea minimum, as
industry.py:132-135 does), with ind_efficiency = 1 and
nonIrrReturnFlowFraction = 0. No row's demand is known before its step, and
a guard stops the run if CWatM's nonIrrDemand after a step differs from the
row's depth. CWatM's own code still removes the water: frac_industry and
totalDemand every step (water_demand.py:1281-1287), pumping
(water_demand.py:2068), withdrawal (water_demand.py:2127-2131) and the store
update (groundwater.py:120). CWatM's demand cannot be negative, so a
negative `abstr` (a net return) is not honoured; run.json reports it. swAbstractionFrac = 0
sends the whole demand to groundwater, where CWatM pumps
nonFossilGroundwaterAbs = min(storGroundwater - 0.01 mm, demand) out of
storGroundwater (groundwater.py:120). limitAbstraction = True leaves any
demand the store cannot meet unmet (unmetDemand) instead of supplying it
from fossil water outside the budget; run.json reports prescribed,
demanded, withdrawn and unmet totals.

Configuration
-------------
Switched off because no probe prescribes them: irrigation, and water demand
unless the forcing carries `abstr` (so paddy fields, irrigation return flows
and, without `abstr`, abstraction do not exist), lakes and
reservoirs, MODFLOW groundwater, inflow hydrographs, environmental flow,
water quality, glaciers, pySnowClim, and kinematic-wave routing (a single
cell has no river network to route along; the within-cell lag CWatM does
have, runoff concentration, stays on). CWatM still initialises its routing
module, so the channel maps and lakeEvaFactor are written with placeholder
values that no flux reads. Potential evaporation is not computed:
calc_evaporation = False makes CWatM read reference evapotranspiration
(ETMaps) and open-water evaporation (E0Maps) directly, and both are fed the
probe's pet. Open water and sealed surfaces have zero area, so E0Maps is read
but used by no flux. Capillary rise and runoff concentration are on, as in
every 30-arcminute template of CWatM and of CWatM-Earth-30min. Preferential
flow is on as in the CWatM-Earth-30min template
(settings_CWatM_template_30min.ini at e9dfd99), the repository the parameter
maps come from; the pinned model repository's own 30-arcminute templates and
its global 30-arcminute test setup ship it off. That switch is a packaging
choice that decides two verdicts: with preferentialFlow = False,
pet-consistency and response-nonnegativity both pass on the gate seeds
(README.md, Sensitivity).

The cell is forest and grassland only. Land cover, soil hydraulics, rooting,
crop coefficients, groundwater recession, relative elevation, slope and
orographic spread are not in static.json; they take the median over the land
cells of CWatM's own 30-arcminute input maps (iiasa/CWatM-Earth-30min at
e9dfd99), listed in GLOBAL_MEDIAN below with the spread in README.md. The
forest share is the area-weighted forest share of forest plus grassland in
the same maps. Calibration factors take the neutral values the templates'
[CALIBRATION] comments document, not the example calibration; SnowMeltCoef,
for which no neutral value is documented, is a choice (see CALIBRATION_DEFAULTS).

From static.json: the cell area (area_km2), the snow threshold
(snow_threshold_degC -> TempSnow), the interception capacity
(canopy_capacity_mm -> interceptCap of forest and grassland) and the soil
capacity (soil_capacity_mm). CWatM's soil store is bounded by saturation, so
the soil column is sized to hold exactly soil_capacity_mm at saturation: the
two storage depths keep the ratio of the global medians and are scaled
together until the saturated storage of the three layers, weighted over both
land covers, equals the capacity. Crop coefficients and interception
capacities are held constant through the year: a global median of a seasonal
cycle mixes hemispheres and describes no catchment.

The timestep
------------
CWatM 1.11 has no sub-daily step. miscInitial sets DtSec = 86400 as a
literal, and the soil, groundwater, snow, interception and runoff-concentration
rates are per day with nothing that rescales them. The adapter therefore
hands CWatM one row per step at every timestep, as the depth that row carries
(rate x step length), and CWatM's calendar advances one day per row. Its snow
scheme reads that calendar: the melt coefficient follows a northern-hemisphere
sine of the day of year, and extra ice melt acts on snow between days 166 and
259, so at PT1H both run on a calendar 24 times too fast. At PT1H
that is the model applying a day of drainage, percolation and evaporation to
every hour of forcing; the resolution probe measures exactly that, and no
parameter is rescaled to hide it.

The model is deterministic; the request seed is recorded and otherwise
unused.
